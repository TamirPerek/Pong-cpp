Pong
====

This is a Pong version of me that I made during my college days.
It is optimized for an educational C-IDE called VirtualC-IDE.

If you want to use this game compiled with a normal compiler, you must have linked SDL in version 1.x.

Due to the dependency on the deprecated SDL version, the game can no longer be run everywhere.
